        <p class="p2"><p>Exploring Lombok</p>
<p>

<p>It's like everything has been saturated with an extra splash color in Lombok, an island of tranquility in the middle of the Indonesian archipelago. Lombok luxury villas capture the atmosphere to a T, with rich Asian décor and calm spaces, thoroughly modern though still old-world. Our collection of Lombok villa rentals are located on the south side of the island, where white-sand beaches line the shore and surroundings are a mix of tourist conveniences - like gourmet restaurants - and authentic Lomboknese experiences. Choose a Lombok vacation villa if you like warm, languid days and you're in the mood to slow down for a little while. </p>

        <p>Experience Lombok villas</p>
        <p>Guests of Lombok villa rentals can be forgiven for wanting to spend their days relaxing in the splendor of their private and luxurious estates. With spacious pools, lush tropical gardens and attentive service luxury Lombok villas offer guests a taste of paradise.

For adventure and culture lovers however, Lombok offers so much more to discover. Venture inland to Ubud, Lombok's green, cultural heart or admire the temple of Uluwatu, perched on an oceanside cliff. Mingle with the crowds at a local market and pick up bargains on fabric and wood crafts made by Lomboknese artisans.

Treck through the lush jungle on the back of an elephant or get a close up look at Lombok’s most colorful residents with a Lombok bird walk. Watersport lovers can take their pick – from diving and snorkeling to surfing some of Lombok’s most exciting activities can be found just offshore.

For those seeking a relaxing escape from the stress of everyday life, Lombok luxury villas are a destination of choice. Ask your Dedicated Concierge about booking massage treatments at your Lombok villa rental or for recommendations on local yoga retreats.
